## Types of Voting  
There are four types of votes.    
**1. Open Party-Listing (OPL)**  
 In this voting method, voters have the freedom to select candidates from any party on the ballot. This openness allows voters to support candidates across party lines based on individual merit or policy preferences.

**2. Closed Party-Listing (CPL)**  
 Contrary to OPL, CPL restricts voters to selecting party from party list instead of candidates. This means that votes are given to the party instead of candidates.

**3. Multiple Popularity Only (MPO)**  
 MPO voting system focuses solely on the popularity of candidates without considering their party affiliation. Voters are presented with a list of candidates, and they vote for multiple candidates based on personal preference or recognition, regardless of party alignment.

**4. Municipal Voting (MV)**  
 MV involves voting specifically for candidates running for municipal positions. This type of vote emphasizes local governance and community representation, allowing voters to select individuals who they believe will best serve their municipality's needs and interests.


## Extension  
This program is designed to open for extension.
